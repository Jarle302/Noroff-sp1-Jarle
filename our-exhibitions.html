        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky
          Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders,
          to Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
          our solar system.

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
          here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
          framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>Robotics and Ai</h2>
        <p>
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
          You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
    <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
